# Adaptive Static Malware Detection for Emerging Threats

AAI-540 MLOps Final Team Project - Group 1

This repository contains the reproducible data-pipeline work for benign-versus-malicious static malware classification using the Win64 portion of EMBER2024. It includes raw-data validation, EDA, leakage-aware feature preparation, and chronological datasets for the model-training handoff. It does **not** train or deploy a model.

## Data pipeline contributions

The data-pipeline ownership area delivered in this repository includes:

- Raw EMBER2024 Win64 dataset setup, file inventory, schema inspection, and documentation.
- Streaming data validation for partitions, row/label counts, data types, missing values, class balance, temporal fields, and SHA-256 duplicate detection.
- EDA notebook and reusable EDA modules covering distributions, outliers, class comparisons, correlations, temporal patterns, and leakage review.
- Identification of a row-duplication issue in the Kaggle copy and SHA-256 deduplication safeguards in downstream processing.
- Leakage-aware static-feature preparation with train-only fitted transformations and a machine-readable feature schema.
- Strict chronological train, validation, test, and reserved-production datasets with split manifests and per-split metadata for model-training handoff.
- Local-first, reproducible documentation and an S3 artifact-handoff plan; no large dataset files are committed to Git.

## Dataset scope and integrity note

The local dataset is the **Win64** EMBER2024 subset only. It contains supplied weekly train and test JSONL files. The Kaggle copy contained repeated SHA-256 records, so validation, EDA sampling, feature preparation, and final split creation all explicitly deduplicate by SHA-256.

The dataset's official temporal layout is 52 training weeks followed by 12 test weeks. The final project uses a documented chronological hybrid strategy rather than a random or 40/10/10/40 split:

| Split | Dates | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Train | 2023-09-24 to 2024-06-29 | Future model fitting |
| Validation | 2024-06-30 to 2024-09-21 | Future selection/threshold work |
| Test | 2024-09-22 to 2024-11-02 | Unseen newer-threat evaluation |
| Reserved production | 2024-11-03 to 2024-12-14 | Final untouched newest-time evaluation |

The test and production-reserve periods derive from the supplied official test partition. Results must therefore be described as using an **official-test-derived temporal subset**, not an untouched full official EMBER2024 test evaluation. Details are in [docs/temporal_split_strategy.md](docs/temporal_split_strategy.md).

## Dataset for model-training teammates

The model-training handoff is the following local-only directory:

```text
data/processed/ember2024_win64_static_v1/
+-- feature_schema.json
+-- processing_report.json
+-- temporal_splits_v1/
    +-- train.csv
    +-- validation.csv
    +-- test.csv
    +-- reserved_production.csv
    +-- split_manifest.json
    +-- metadata/
        +-- train_metadata.json
        +-- validation_metadata.json
        +-- test_metadata.json
        +-- reserved_production_metadata.json
```

Use only the ordered columns in `feature_schema.json` → `model_feature_columns` as `X`. Do **not** use `record_id`, `label`, `source_partition`, `source_week_start`, or `source_week_end` as model features. `label` is the binary target; the remaining non-feature columns are lineage metadata.

Large raw and processed data must not be committed to Git. Share these artifacts through S3, not GitHub.

## Local setup and pipeline

Run commands from the repository root (`project/`).

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The reusable scripts use only the Python standard library. The requirements file supplies notebook visualization packages.

```powershell
# Optional only when raw data is available locally
python scripts/run_validation.py
python scripts/run_eda.py
python scripts/prepare_features.py
python scripts/create_temporal_splits.py
```

Open `notebooks/01_ember2024_eda.ipynb` in Jupyter after its required artifacts are present. The optional generation cells default to `False`; they do not rerun large raw-data jobs unless intentionally enabled.

## S3 handoff for AWS Learner Lab

AWS access is only required for the teammate responsible for AWS/S3/SageMaker work. The data pipeline is local-first. Do not commit credentials, access keys, bucket names containing personal information, or large data files.

### 1. Configure AWS access

In the AWS Learner Lab terminal or configured local terminal, confirm the active identity:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If the CLI is not already configured, use the Learner Lab-provided temporary credentials and region. Do not place credentials in this repository.

### 2. Choose a bucket and upload only required artifacts

Replace `YOUR-BUCKET-NAME` with the S3 bucket created by the AWS owner. The following uploads the model-training handoff and the reports needed to view the submitted notebook without rerunning raw-data processing:

```bash
aws s3 sync data/processed/ember2024_win64_static_v1/ \
  s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ember2024/processed/ember2024_win64_static_v1/

aws s3 sync reports/validation/ \
  s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ember2024/reports/validation/

aws s3 sync reports/eda/ \
  s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ember2024/reports/eda/
```

This intentionally does **not** upload `data/raw/` by default. The raw Win64 JSONL data is large (~33.5 GB locally) and is only needed if someone must rerun validation, EDA sampling, or feature preparation from source.

If raw-data reproducibility is required and the bucket has adequate storage, upload it separately:

```bash
aws s3 sync data/raw/ember2024/ \
  s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ember2024/raw/ember2024/
```

### 3. Download artifacts in another environment

From a SageMaker notebook instance, EC2 machine, or another authorized environment, recreate the expected local layout:

```bash
aws s3 sync s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ember2024/processed/ember2024_win64_static_v1/ \
  data/processed/ember2024_win64_static_v1/

aws s3 sync s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ember2024/reports/validation/ \
  reports/validation/

aws s3 sync s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ember2024/reports/eda/ \
  reports/eda/
```

With these downloaded artifacts, the submitted notebook can display its completed validation/EDA results, feature schema, and final split metadata without the raw dataset. Raw files are necessary only for optional regeneration cells.

### Recommended S3 prefix layout

```text
s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ember2024/
+-- processed/ember2024_win64_static_v1/
+-- reports/validation/
+-- reports/eda/
+-- raw/ember2024/                 # Optional; large and immutable
```

Keep raw data immutable. When a later pipeline version is created, write it under a new versioned processed prefix rather than overwriting `ember2024_win64_static_v1`.
