# Final EMBER2024 temporal split strategy

## Decision

The project uses `ember2024_win64_temporal_hybrid_v1`, a four-way strictly chronological split. It intentionally does **not** apply the course 40/10/10/40 ratio because that would move official training weeks into a later production period and obscure EMBER2024's official temporal boundary.

| Final split | Source weeks | Dates | Source partition | Role |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Train | 40 | 2023-09-24 to 2024-06-29 | Official train | Future model fitting only |
| Validation | 12 | 2024-06-30 to 2024-09-21 | Official train | Future model/threshold selection only |
| Test | 6 | 2024-09-22 to 2024-11-02 | Official test | Unseen newer-threat evaluation |
| Reserved production | 6 | 2024-11-03 to 2024-12-14 | Official test | Final untouched newest-time evaluation |

This order prevents future information from entering earlier splits. All rows are deduplicated by SHA-256 during feature preparation, and test records whose hash was already observed in train are removed before split creation.

## Important interpretation

The 12-week official EMBER2024 test partition is divided into a six-week project test and a six-week production reserve. Therefore, course results must be described as evaluation on an **official-test-derived temporal test subset**, not the untouched full official EMBER2024 test set.

## Generate handoff datasets

First regenerate prepared features so their non-feature lineage columns include the source week:

```powershell
python scripts/prepare_features.py
```

Then create the four final splits:

```powershell
python scripts/create_temporal_splits.py
```

The split directory contains `train.csv`, `validation.csv`, `test.csv`, `reserved_production.csv`, a shared `split_manifest.json`, and one metadata JSON document per split. Every metadata document includes row count, class distribution, source-partition/week counts, feature schema name/fingerprint/order, generation timestamp, and effective configuration.

Use only the feature columns named in the schema for training. `record_id`, `label`, `source_partition`, and source-week fields are metadata, not model features.
